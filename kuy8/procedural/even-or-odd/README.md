### 🧩 Challenge Description

**[Link to the kata on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53da3dbb4a5168369a0000fe)**

_Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers._

---

### 🛠 Approach: Procedural Programming

This solution is implemented using a **procedural programming style**, focusing on simple control flow and function-based without object-oriented constructs.

---

### ▶ Example Usage

```python
from src.even_or_odd import even_or_odd

odd_number = 7
print(even_or_odd(odd_number))  # Output: Odd

even_number = 10
print(even_or_odd(even_number))  # Output: Even
```

---

### ✔ Running the Tests

Tests are written using `pytest`.
To run them, navigate to the `kyu8/procedural/even-or-odd` directory and execute:

```bash
pytest
```
